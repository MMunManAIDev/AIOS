Version: 0.1 (Draft)

1. Overview

This document describes the architecture and initial steps for building a prototype operating system (OS) that integrates a hot-swappable Large Language Model (LLM) as a native, system-level component. The LLM functions as a semantic interface layer, allowing users and processes to interact with the OS using natural language.

2. Objectives

Enable semantic OS-level interaction (e.g., "Computer, install Steam")

Provide hot-swappable LLM support via an abstraction layer

Maintain traditional programmatic control paths for fallback/debugging

Support both CLI and GUI interaction paradigms

Allow modular system composition via LLM-aware service hooks

3. System Architecture

3.1 Core Components

Kernel (Base OS)

A minimal Linux kernel (e.g., Alpine or Arch base)

Userland utilities for standard POSIX compatibility

LLM Runtime Service (llm-core)

Runs as a systemd service or init-managed process

Connects to local or remote LLM via a Model Adapter Layer

Model Adapter Layer

Supports OpenAI-compatible APIs (e.g., LM Studio, Ollama)

Isolates prompt templates, capabilities, and memory handling

Semantic Command Interface (SCI)

Replaces shell or GUI prompt with natural language interpreter

Executes validated instructions via syscall bridge

Permission Broker (optional)

Validates and approves potentially destructive actions

Configurable per user and context

4. LLM Agent Capabilities

Semantic CLI interaction ("Find all files over 1GB")

System configuration and package management ("Install Nginx")

Application launching and window management

User assistance and documentation lookup

Script and automation generation

5. Hot-Swapping Models

Standard model contracts describe available capabilities

Swapping handled via llmctl switch <model_id>

Active memory/state saved and restored across swaps

6. Security Considerations

Run LLM in sandbox with strict I/O limits

Log and review all executed commands via audit service

Optional user approval layer for elevated permissions

Use model cards to verify LLM origin and behavior contracts

7. Initial VM Prototype Plan

7.1 Requirements

VirtualBox, VMware, or KVM

Ubuntu Server 22.04 (or Alpine if going minimal)

2 vCPU, 4GB RAM minimum

Internet access or local LLM deployment (Ollama/LM Studio)

7.2 Steps

Create a new VM with Ubuntu Server

Install basic dev tools: build-essential, git, curl, python3

Install Ollama and a small LLM (e.g., llama3:8b)

Create a system service llm-core.service that calls a wrapper script to interact with the LLM

Build a minimal semantic CLI (scli) that:

Takes user input

Sends prompt to llm-core

Parses LLM response and optionally asks for confirmation

Executes safe shell commands with logging

Optional: Add voice input with vosk or whisper.cpp

8. Next Steps

Define system prompt architecture and LLM instruction set

Create prompt templates for system actions

Build MVP of scli

Harden model isolation and define swap spec

9. Long-Term Vision

OS as an intelligent agent with pluggable cognition

Local-first but cloud-extendable

GUI layer with semantic window manager

Modular services with semantic contracts

This should not be science fiction any longer.
